# Curly_OOP
Curly is an a programming language built on Plait- a subset of Racket. The following codes demonstrate an Object Oriented implementation of Curly with key language tools like parser, type-checker and interpreter. I developed Curly as part of my project work for CS6520 Programming Languages course undertaken at the University of Utah Fall 2018.
